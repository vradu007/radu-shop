## Purpose

This was a project that I had done and had to work on for my React bootcamp course.

The project is meant to prove the developer's knowledge of frontend development using the React library.

## Used technologies

The used technologies in this project are React, Hooks, Redux and Firebase.

## How the project was created

The project has been created with "npx create-react-app" and has been managed with yarn

## Info about the project

The project uses an older repository.

The products are stored in a json file, and the login to google and facebook uses firebase functionalities.

The only not-working functionality up to date that I know of is the facebook login functionality - because of a firebase connection issue. The google login works just fine, and is implemented similarly..

## How to run the project

After cloning the repo, just run `yarn` in a terminal in the project folder, and after node modules are installed, run `yarn start`.

## Future of the app

The first order of business should be getting rid of the facebook login bug..:).

After that, I will look into deploying the app on online on Heroku or GitHub pages.

I am looking to learn node.js and express.js, and after I am done learning these technologies, I hope to be able to create a backend for this application.
